🌍 Air Quality Analysis of Indian Cities
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing air quality across major Indian cities using real-world data. It explores daily variations in the Air Quality Index (AQI), pollutant contributions, and seasonal trends to better understand the growing concern of air pollution in India.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze city-wise air quality patterns using AQI data.

Identify seasonal and regional variations in pollution levels.

Highlight the pollutants contributing most to poor air quality.

Provide insights through data visualization and trend analysis.

🗂️ Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Air Quality Data in India (2015–2020)

Size: ~29 MB

Period: 2015–2020

Features:

City, Date, AQI, AQI_Bucket

Pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3

🔧 Methodology

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning missing values, formatting dates.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying pollution trends.

Visualization – AQI variations across cities, pollutants, and seasons.

Comparative Study – Comparing the most polluted vs. least polluted cities.

Tools & Libraries Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for visualizations

📊 Key Insights

Many Indian cities consistently fall into Poor to Severe AQI categories.

PM2.5 and PM10 are the major contributors to poor air quality.

Winter months show the highest pollution due to stubble burning and weather conditions.

🚀 Future Work

Develop ML models to predict AQI levels.

Incorporate weather data for better forecasting.

Create a real-time dashboard for public monitoring.
