# Air-Quality-Analysis-of-Indian-Cities
This project analyzes air quality across Indian cities (2015â€“2020) using AQI and pollutant data. It explores seasonal trends, pollutant contributions (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3), and city-wise comparisons through data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations to derive insights for awareness and policy.
